## Reporting a Vulnerability

Every time there are updates to Katan we try to ensure that there are no security issues, vulnerabilities or any kind of malicious code or software present in the project. But, anything can happen in some environment that we don't expect in ways that we don't.

If you find any vulnerability, security issue or the presence of malicious software or code in Katan, please let us know through the [mailto:security@katan.org](security@katan.org).
